# ladderr
Access your remote files directly from qBittorrent Web UI, just like in the desktop app.

Current version: [v0.5.3](#Recent-changes)

üí• You will need to re-install the latest [`ladderr.reg`](https://github.com/Luffier/ladderr/blob/master/ladderr.reg) with version 0.5.3 üí•

‚ö†Ô∏è The script is enabled on all pages by default. See [section below](#security-concerns) if you want to fix this ‚ö†Ô∏è

## How does it work?

By leveraging protocol handlers, a File Explorer window can be opened directly
to a specified network path. This replicates the desktop behavior identically.

After mapping your remote and local path in the script settings, Ladderr can create a
protocol link pointing to your local files (by using information that's already available
in the Web UI). When opening a file or folder (by using the `Open destination folder`,
`Open` or `Open containing folder` menu items or by double-clicking the file or folder
in the `Content` tab), the protocol is invoked and an inline Powershell script is executed
to parse and open the target path.

The files in this repo:
- ladderr.js: the userscript itself
- ladderr.reg: the custom protocol handlers `ladderr-open:` and `ladderr-select:`
- uninstall-ladderr.reg: removes the protocol handlers from the registry
- urlparser.ps1: Powershell script describing the one-line code that is executed when the protocols are invoked

To learn more about protocol handlers, you can read [MS-URI-Handlers](https://github.com/amartinsec/MS-URI-Handlers).

## How to use

- Install the custom protocol handlers by double-clicking [`ladderr.reg`](https://github.com/Luffier/ladderr/blob/master/ladderr.reg) (can be easily removed with [`uninstall-ladderr.reg`](https://github.com/Luffier/ladderr/blob/master/uninstall-ladderr.reg)).
- Install the userscript from [greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/479135-ladderr), [openuserjs](https://openuserjs.org/scripts/luffier/Ladderr) or directly from the [repo](https://github.com/Luffier/ladderr).
- Configure the root path mapping in the script settings menu (see section below).

### Path mapping

We need to map your qBittorrent remote root path to your local network root path. 
This can be done by going to the `Tools` navbar menu and clicking `Ladderr Options`.

</p>

The remote path should be the root folder that you configured 
in `Default Save Path` (`Options\Downloads\Saving Management`) and your local root
path the equivalent in your local machine.

</p>

For example, if you have a network location:
- *Default Save Path*: `/data/downloads`
- **Remote root server path**: `/data/`
- **Local root path**: `D:\`

And if you have an NFS\SMB\Samba server:
- *Default Save Path*: `/downloads`
- **Remote root server path**: `/downloads`
- **Local root path**: `\\server_name_or_ip\very\long\path\downloads`

## What's next
- Linux support (any help would be appreciated).

## Limitations
- Only works in Windows.

## Security concerns

Since everyone's Web UI will have a different URL, **the script is active on all pages by default**.
There's a check to detect when the page is a qBittorrent Web UI but to be safe you should change this.

For Tapermonkey:

1. Go to your `Dashboard`.
2. Hover over the Ladderr entry and click the `Edit` button in the rightmost column.
3. Go to the `Settings` tab (left side below the Ladderr logo).
4. Deselect `Original matches` in the `Includes/Excludes` section.
5. Add your qBittorrent Web UI URL by clicking `Add...` below the `User matches` box.

For Violentmonkey:

1. Go to your `Dashboard` (‚öôÔ∏è icon).
2. Hover over the Ladderr entry and click the `Edit` button (`</>` icon).
3. Go to the `Settings` tab.
4. Deselect `Keep original` under `@match rules`.
5. Add your qBittorrent Web UI URL in the adjacent text box.

Alternatively, if your extension doesn't allow this, you can do it manually:

1. Remove the following lines: `// @match https://*/` and `// @match http://*/ `.
2. Add your custom URL. For example: `// @match https://192.168.1.100:8080/` or `// @match http://myserver.local/`.

Unfortunately, if done manually, you'll have to redo this with each update.

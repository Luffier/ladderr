# ladderr
Access your remote files directly from qBittorrent Web UI, just like in the desktop app.

Current version: [v0.5.8](#Recent-changes)

üí• You will need to re-install the latest [`ladderr.reg`](https://github.com/Luffier/ladderr/blob/master/ladderr.reg) if you had a version prior to v0.5.4 üí•

‚ö†Ô∏è The script is enabled on all pages by default. See [section below](#security-concerns) if you want to change this ‚ö†Ô∏è

‚ö†Ô∏è There's a bug in Windows that keeps explorer.exe processes open even after closing their respective window, if you never restart your machine you may be filling your RAM inadvertently. This issue seems to be fixed in the 24H2 update (see [related issue](https://github.com/Luffier/ladderr/issues/17)) ‚ö†Ô∏è

## How does it work?

By leveraging protocol handlers, a File Explorer window can be opened directly
to a specified network path.

After mapping your remote and local path in the script settings, Ladderr can create a
protocol link pointing to your local files (by using information that's already available
in the Web UI). When opening a file or folder (by using the `Open destination folder`,
`Open` or `Open containing folder` menu items or by double-clicking the file or folder
in the `Content` tab), the protocol is invoked and an inline Powershell script is executed
to parse and open the target path.

The files in this repo:
- ladderr.js: the userscript itself
- ladderr.reg: the custom protocol handlers `ladderr-open:` and `ladderr-select:`
- uninstall-ladderr.reg: removes the protocol handlers from the registry
- urlparser.ps1: Powershell script describing the one-line code that is executed when the protocols are invoked

To learn more about protocol handlers, you can read [MS-URI-Handlers](https://github.com/amartinsec/MS-URI-Handlers).

## How to use

- Install the custom protocol handlers by double-clicking [`ladderr.reg`](https://github.com/Luffier/ladderr/blob/master/ladderr.reg) (can be easily removed with [`uninstall-ladderr.reg`](https://github.com/Luffier/ladderr/blob/master/uninstall-ladderr.reg)).
- Install the userscript from [greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/479135-ladderr), [openuserjs](https://openuserjs.org/scripts/luffier/Ladderr) or directly from the [repo](https://github.com/Luffier/ladderr).
- Configure the root path mapping in the settings menu (see section below).

### Path mapping

We need to map your qBittorrent remote root path to your local network root path. 
This can be done by going to the `Tools` navbar menu and clicking `Ladderr Options`.

</p>

The remote path should be the root folder that you configured 
in `Default Save Path` (`Options\Downloads\Saving Management`) and your local root
path the equivalent in your local machine.

</p>

For example, if you have a network location:
- *Default Save Path*: `/data/downloads`
- **Remote root server path**: `/data/`
- **Local root path**: `D:\`

And if you have an NFS\SMB\Samba server:
- *Default Save Path*: `/downloads`
- **Remote root server path**: `/downloads`
- **Local root path**: `\\server_name_or_ip\very\long\path\downloads`

## What's next
- Linux support (any help would be appreciated).

## Limitations
- Only works in Windows.
- In Chromium-based browsers, and when using HTTP, it will ask for permission when opening a new file/folder. For a more seamless experience, use HTTPS. If your server is local, look up self-signed certs with mkcert, or use this [solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlcVx-k-02E).

## Security concerns

Since everyone's Web UI will have a different URL, **the script is active on all pages by default**.
There's a check to detect when the page is a qBittorrent Web UI but to be safe you should change this.

For Tapermonkey:

1. Go to your `Dashboard`.
2. Hover over the Ladderr entry and click the `Edit` button in the rightmost column.
3. Go to the `Settings` tab (left side below the Ladderr logo).
4. Deselect `Original matches` in the `Includes/Excludes` section.
5. Add your qBittorrent Web UI URL by clicking `Add...` below the `User matches` box.

For Violentmonkey:

1. Go to your `Dashboard` (‚öôÔ∏è icon).
2. Hover over the Ladderr entry and click the `Edit` button (`</>` icon).
3. Go to the `Settings` tab.
4. Deselect `Keep original` under `@match rules`.
5. Add your qBittorrent Web UI URL in the adjacent text box.

Alternatively, if your extension doesn't allow this, you can do it manually:

1. Remove the following lines: `// @match https://*/` and `// @match http://*/ `.
2. Add your custom URL. For example: `// @match https://192.168.1.100:8080/` or `// @match http://myserver.local/`.

Unfortunately, if done manually, you'll have to redo this with each update.
